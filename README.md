## Overview
Doggy Journal is a simple web application that helps dog owners to keep track of their dog's daily activities such as feeding, hydration, and potty breaks. It uses a visual and interactive interface to allow users to easily record and review their petâ€™s activities.

## Video Tutorial
The following video explains the application in detail:

## Tech Stack
JavaScript Bricks is built using the following technologies:
- JavaScript: The game logic and interactions.
- HTML: The structure of the web page.
- CSS: The styling and layout of the web page.
## Installation
To get Doggy Journal up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/doggy-journal.git
   ```
2. Change directory into the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd doggy-journal
   ```
3. There's no need for any additional setup. Just open the `index.html` file in your browser.
## Usage
1. When the app is first launched, you will see a cover image. Click on the cover to access the main page.
2. On the main page, you will see sections for food, water, and potty time.
3. Each section has a visual bar, two buttons to increment or decrement the bar, and timestamps that record when the bar was modified.
4. Use the "+" and "-" buttons to record your dog's food, water, and potty activities.
5. You can navigate between days using the arrows at the top.
6. The app will save the data in your browser's local storage, so it persists across page refreshes and browser restarts.
## How It Works
Doggy Journal uses HTML for its structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
1. **HTML**: The HTML code in `index.html` contains the main structure of the page. It includes sections for each activity (food, water, potty) and buttons for user interactions.
2. **CSS**: The `style.css` file contains the styling for the app. It includes the layout, fonts, and other visual elements.
3. **JavaScript**: The `script.js` file contains the logic for handling user interactions, updating the visual bars, and saving/retrieving data from local storage.
The application utilizes the browser's local storage to save the state of the bars and the timestamps. This allows the data to persist across browser sessions.
